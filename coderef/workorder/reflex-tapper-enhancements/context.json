  "description": "Comprehensive enhancements to Reflex Tapper game including dynamic rule phases, adaptive difficulty, colored targets with rewards/penalties, decoy targets, reaction time tracking, multiple game modes, power-ups, accessibility improvements, persistence, and advanced gameplay mechanics for training and skill-building.",
  "goal": "Transform Reflex Tapper from a simple reaction game into an advanced training tool with dynamic difficulty, multiple modes, rule-based gameplay, performance tracking, and accessibility features to provide engaging skill-building experiences.",
  "requirements": [
    "Add dynamic rule phases with changing instructions mid-run (e.g., tap any, then tap only orange, then avoid red)",
    "Vary spawn interval and target lifetime over time to create automatic difficulty ramp (faster spawns, shorter visibility)",
    "Introduce colored targets with different rewards/penalties tied to phase instructions",
    "Add decoy targets that should not be tapped to train go/no-go decision making",
    "Track reaction time per target and show average/best reaction in GameOver modal as performance stat",
    "Provide animated New Rule banner when phases change so players notice midgame rule shifts",
    "Add multiple modes (Classic 20s, Sudden Death 1-mistake, Burst 5s) for variety and different training goals",
    "Implement adaptive difficulty that adjusts spawn rate and penalties based on recent accuracy to keep players in challenge sweet spot",
    "Add simple power-ups (extra time, slow motion, double score) as rare special targets to break monotony",
    "Provide short pre-round countdown (3, 2, 1, Go) instead of spawning immediately so players are ready",
    "Add sound effects or subtle haptics for hits, misses, and phase changes for stronger feedback",
    "Surface streaks/combo scoring (consecutive hits without misses increase multiplier) to reward consistency",
    "Add minimal pause overlay with current rule reminder and controls hints for clarity",
    "Show small in-run progress indicator for time and phase timeline so players anticipate upcoming difficulty spikes",
    "Improve accessibility with ARIA labels, keyboard activation, and aria-live region for score/time updates",
    "Respect prefers-reduced-motion by swapping Framer Motion transitions for simpler fades or instant changes",
    "Add color-blind-friendly patterns or shapes on targets so color-based rules remain readable for all players",
    "Persist best score and best reaction time locally (localStorage) and show them in GameOver modal as long-term goals",
    "Add lightweight stats screen (total games, average score, hit rate) to reinforce training/skill-building angle",
    "Randomize spawn patterns slightly (bursts, gaps) instead of perfect fixed rhythm to avoid predictability",
    "Clamp simultaneous target count and tune overlap rules so screen never becomes unreadable at high difficulty",
    "Integrate tiny in-UI how to play panel explaining targets, colors, and penalties, always in sync with documented rules"

  "constraints": [
    "Must maintain existing game functionality during enhancement",
    "No breaking changes to component API or props",
    "Must preserve all existing features (basic tapping, timer, scoring)",
    "Performance optimizations must not degrade user experience on low-end devices",
    "Accessibility improvements must follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines",
    "localStorage usage must handle quota exceeded errors gracefully"
